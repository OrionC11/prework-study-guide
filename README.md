# Prework Study Guide

## Description

    This project is a prework study guide with the aim of allowing me to keep track of notes from my bootcamp prework for quick easy access to information which is useful to me. It solves the problem of needing an easy way to study certain sections of the prework which i felt needed more study. Through the process i learned basic HTML CSS Git, and JS and how to intertwine them together to create a basic web application in the form of an easy-access study guide.

## Installation
